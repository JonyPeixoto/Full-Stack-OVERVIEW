How can I think like programmer?

- Think in step by step.
- Thhink in the actions of step by step.

-------------------------

1) Be on the crosswalk
{
    Be on track?
        Did the cars stop?
            FINAL ACTION: Can I pass through?
}
I AM NOT ON THE CROSSWALK AND
    I need go to the crosswalk.
    As long as you do not reach the lane, continue until you do.
